## Biography

I'm J√©r√©my Ravenel‚Äîa farm boy turned data mercenary and now entrepreneur, passionate about practical innovation to make our digital lives less chaotic.

I help people and companies create data & AI products that make work easier and more efficient.

My journey started in finance, where I discovered the real world was less automated than expected. Frustration led me to coding, Python, and Jupyter notebooks‚Äîand eventually founding [CashStory](https://www.cashstory.com), bridging business and tech teams across France.

Currently, I'm leading [Naas.ai](https://naas.ai), building an open Universal Data & AI Platform to help organizations create powerful ecosystems of AI assistants. Our goal? Empower organizations to leverage ontologies as a unifying field between data, AI models, workflows, analytics, and external systems.

I'm also a Research Associate in Applied Ontology at the University at Buffalo, working to make AI systems more understandable and trustworthy. I advise companies on Data and AI strategy at Forvis Mazars.

This mix of research, hands-on development, and strategy is the intersection of philosophy, tech, and business I always dreamed of.

## Philosophy

> ‚ÄúAnyone should be able to turn their data into a valuable asset. I build bridges to make it happen.‚Äù

- AI isn‚Äôt magic‚Äîit needs clear structure and disciplined data management.
- Ontologies and knowledge graphs are essential for robust, trustworthy AI.
- The real work is in organizing, contextualizing, and connecting data‚Äînot just chasing the latest algorithm.

**Insights:**

- **The Role of Ontologies in AI:** Companies like Palantir use ontologies to integrate data, enable deeper insights, and deliver advanced, context-aware AI solutions.
- **Maintaining Ontologies:** Strategic balance, regular updates, domain expert collaboration, and clear documentation are key.
- **Knowledge Graphs & AI:** Without ontologies, knowledge graphs are chaotic. Structured ontologies give semantic depth and reliability.
- **LLMs & Data Organization:** AI‚Äôs value is limited by the messiness of business data‚Äîorganization is critical.
- **GraphRAG & Challenges:** Data quality, retrieval, graph construction, LLM integration, scalability, and ethics are crucial for next-gen AI assistants.
